To make for project:
	make config-alpha; make
Have made before and attempt to recompile:
	make clean

Run sim-bpred with perceptron predictor:
	-bpred perceptron
	default option: 36 Global history registers
			0 Local history register
			1024 perceptrons
Run sim-bpred with perceptron predictor with options:
	-bpred perceptron -bpred:perceptron x y z
	x: number of Global history registers
		must > 0
	y: number of Local history registers
		must >= 0
	z: number of perceptrons
		must >=0 && power of 2

To see helps and instructions to run
	./sim-bpred -bpred -h

Example:
	./sim-bpred -bpred perceptron -bpred:perceptron 32 4 1024 cc1.alpha -O 1stmt.i
