This  implements a driver in C++ to run the experiments.

The experiments are provided as a vector of vector of strings.
If the driver detects that the experiment is to be redirected to a file,
it will create a tempfile. NOTE: does not deal with the case when a file is provided.

The driver assumes that there is a sim-bpred file in ../benchmarks/ and that this is where the
benchmarks are also kept.
